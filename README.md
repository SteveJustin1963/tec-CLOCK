# tec-CLOCK

### Horology

This program will allow the TEC to be used as a CLOCK. The display is used as the readout and the time can be set, reset, countdown, countup, death clock, etc.
Be sure not to get chrono-obsessive-personality-disorder COPD.

- Optical, the output of which is derived from an optical frequency standard, correct to within a fractional uncertainty of 2 parts in 10^18, esonate on frequencies up to 100,000 times higher than the cesium-133 used in atomic clocks. Instead of relying on cesium, optical clocks use elements like strontium and ytterbium paired with lasers to detect their resonant frequencies. 
- Laser, use atoms or ions that oscillate approximately 100,000 times higher than microwave frequencies, in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

- GPS sync clock, Each GPS satellite contains multiple atomic clocks that contribute very precise time data to the GPS signals. GPS receivers decode these signals, effectively synchronizing each receiver to the atomic clocks. By tracking a GPS satellite, a receiver can record the time differences between its own receiver clock and the satellite clock. https://www.masterclock.com/support/library/gps-network-time-synchronization 
- NTP server, Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol that allows the synchronization of system clocks (from desktops to servers). Having synchronized clocks is not only convenient but required for many distributed applications.There are a large number of public NTP time servers available across the Internet.
 eg A free, global time service that you can use to synchronize to Google's atomic clocks.
